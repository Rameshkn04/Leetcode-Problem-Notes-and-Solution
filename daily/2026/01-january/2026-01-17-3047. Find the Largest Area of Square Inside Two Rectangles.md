# 🟦 3047. Find the Largest Area of Square Inside Two Rectangles

## 📌 Problem Statement

There exist **n rectangles** in a 2D plane with edges parallel to the x and y axes.

You are given two integer arrays:

- `bottomLeft[i] = [ai, bi]` → bottom-left corner of the `iᵗʰ` rectangle  
- `topRight[i] = [ci, di]` → top-right corner of the `iᵗʰ` rectangle  

### 🎯 Objective

Find the **maximum area of a square** that can fit **inside the intersection region of at least two rectangles**.

If **no two rectangles intersect**, return `0`.

---

## 🧠 Key Insight

- The **intersection of two rectangles** is itself a rectangle.
- The **largest square** that fits inside a rectangle has:
  
side = min(width, height)


- Area of square:
  
So, for **every pair of rectangles**, we:
1. Compute their intersection
2. Check if it exists
3. Compute the largest square area inside it
4. Track the maximum

---

## 🚀 Approach (Brute Force – Accepted)

Since `n ≤ 200`, checking **all rectangle pairs** is efficient.

### Steps

1. Iterate over all pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j`
2. Compute intersection boundaries:
 - `left = max(x₁_left, x₂_left)`
 - `right = min(x₁_right, x₂_right)`
 - `bottom = max(y₁_bottom, y₂_bottom)`
 - `top = min(y₁_top, y₂_top)`
3. Calculate:
 - `width = right - left`
 - `height = top - bottom`
4. If both are positive:
 - `side = min(width, height)`
 - `area = side²`
5. Return the maximum area found

## ✅ Python Implementation

```python
class Solution:
  def largestSquareArea(self, bottomLeft, topRight):
      n = len(bottomLeft)
      max_area = 0

      for i in range(n):
          for j in range(i + 1, n):
              x_left = max(bottomLeft[i][0], bottomLeft[j][0])
              y_bottom = max(bottomLeft[i][1], bottomLeft[j][1])
              x_right = min(topRight[i][0], topRight[j][0])
              y_top = min(topRight[i][1], topRight[j][1])

              width = x_right - x_left
              height = y_top - y_bottom

              if width > 0 and height > 0:
                  side = min(width, height)
                  max_area = max(max_area, side * side)

      return max_area
Input
bottomLeft = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,1]]
topRight  = [[3,3],[4,4],[6,6]]

Output
1

Explanation

Rectangles (0,1) and (1,2) intersect

Largest square side = 1

Area = 1 × 1 = 1

⏱️ Complexity Analysis
Metric	Complexity
Time	O(n²)
Space	O(1)
⚠️ Edge Cases

No intersecting rectangles → return 0

Intersection width or height = 0 → invalid

Intersection of more than two rectangles is automatically handled

🏁 Final Notes

This is a geometry + brute-force optimization problem

Key idea is recognizing that the largest square fits by limiting side length
