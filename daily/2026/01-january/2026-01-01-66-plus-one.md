# 2026-01-01 — 66. Plus One

Notes and approach for problem 66.

Difficulty: Easy
Topic: Arrays, Math
Source: LeetCode

Problem Statement

You are given a non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer.
Each digit is stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.

Increment the integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

Key Observation

If the last digit is less than 9, simply increment it.

If the last digit is 9, it becomes 0, and a carry must propagate to the left.

If all digits are 9, an extra digit 1 is required at the front.

Approach

Traverse the array from right to left:

If the current digit is less than 9, increment it and return the array.

If the digit is 9, set it to 0 and continue propagating the carry.

If the loop finishes, it means all digits were 9; prepend 1.

Algorithm

Iterate from the last index to the first.

Handle carry propagation.

Add a leading 1 if necessary.

Time and Space Complexity
Metric	Complexity
Time	O(n)
Space	O(1) (excluding output)
Python Implementation
class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(digits) - 1, -1, -1):
            if digits[i] < 9:
                digits[i] += 1
                return digits
            digits[i] = 0
        
        return [1] + digits

Edge Cases

Single digit [9] → [1, 0]

Multiple trailing 9s → carry propagation

No carry required → direct increment

Key Takeaway

Carry-based problems are best handled by traversing from right to left, mimicking elementary arithmetic.
